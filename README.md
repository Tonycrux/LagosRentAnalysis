# Prediction of Urban House Rental Prices in Lagos - Nigeria: A Machine Learning Approach

This Reopsitory contains the dataset and code for the above paper published at ABUAD Journal of Engineering Research and Development (AJERD).Often, prospective tenants need to know the rental price of an apartment, and homeowners need to know how best to price
their apartments. This work aims to predict house rental prices in Lagos, Nigeria, using machine learning by examining the relationship
between the rental price and features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, location and house status(newly built,
furnished, and/or serviced).

### Below is a visual representation of the top ten cities by number of houses:
